# Default minimal hosts file to be provided to containers
# Podman uses the local machine's hosts file by default, which can cause problems if you have conflicting entries with 
# a sandcastle network alias
# Loopback entries; do not change.
# For historical reasons, localhost precedes localhost.localdomain:
127.0.0.1   localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4
::1         localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6
