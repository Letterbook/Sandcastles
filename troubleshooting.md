# Issues

These are some issues you might encounter, and steps you can take to fix them

## Error `invalid spec: :/var/run/docker.sock:z: empty section between colons`

You might have forgotten to run the bootstrap command. If you're not sure, you can just run it again. Bootstrap will
refuse to make any changes at all if it detects that the bootstrapped config is already present.

Or, bootstrap might have failed to detect the location of your docker daemon socket. In that case, you can add the
correct path to the `.env` file that was generated by bootstrap.

### Fix
1. To find the correct path, run `docker info` or `docker context show`
2. Then add that path to the `DOCKER_PATH=` var in your `.env` file.
